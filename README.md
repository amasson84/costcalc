## Introduction

The cost calculator is an online project for calculating the cost of services. It's originally designed for helping researcher for estimating the cost of managing data. The user can calculate the cost of the data life cycle directly from the interface.

Categories, Providers, Cost can be easily updated by just changing the **data.js** so it can be adapted for your own institution.


## How to use it

The structure is highly modular and can be extended for different projects. 
All the information are stored on javascript and the system only uses javascript 
libraries making really easy to install and update.

You don't need a specific webserver (but you can use one), just use your github repo 
and create a pages link your cost calculator will be accessible

For local use, you need a mini web server such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
